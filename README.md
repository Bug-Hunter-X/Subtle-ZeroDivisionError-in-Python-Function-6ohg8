This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python related to zero division and implicit return. The `bug.py` file contains a function with a potential ZeroDivisionError that can be challenging to spot due to the use of implicit return and conditional logic. The solution is presented in `bugSolution.py`, clarifying the return and adding explicit exception handling. This example highlights the importance of explicit returns and robust error handling in Python.
